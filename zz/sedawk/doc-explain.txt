NAME:
DBclose - closes a database
SYNTAX:
voidDBclose(fdesc)
DBFILE *fdesc;
fdesc- pointer to database file descriptor
USAGE:
DESC:
DBclose() closes a file when given its database file descriptor.
Your pending writes to that file will be completed before the
file is closed. All of your update locks are removed.
*fdesc becomes invalid.
Other users are not affected when you call DBclose(). Their update
locks and pending writes are not changed.
Note that there is no default file as there is in BASIC.
*fdesc must specify an open file.
DBclose() is analogous to the CLOSE statement in BASIC.
RETURNS:
There is no return value
******************************************************************


Put \n after and before *lines
sed -e '1a \\n' -e '$i \\n' doc.txt -i
this puts 2 lines in for some reason.
